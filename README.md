SPARC: SURVIVAL PSEUDO-LABEL ADAPTIVE REFINEMENT AND CALIBRATION
# Abstract
Survival prediction beyond observed follow-up poses a fundamental challenge: when the prediction horizon $\tau$ exceeds maximum observed time $t_{\max}^{\mathrm{obs}}$, standard methods either fail or require unverifiable parametric assumptions. We introduce SPARC (Survival Prediction via Adaptive Refinement and Calibration), a framework that addresses this through iterative pseudo-label refinement under survival-theoretic constraints. Unlike conventional approaches that treat pseudo-observations as static preprocessing outputs, SPARC refines them across iterations while enforcing hard constraints: deceased patients receive near-zero survival probability ($\leq 0.001$), and censored patients retain minimum probability ($\geq 0.20$) reflecting their at-risk status. We evaluate on a clinical cohort ($n = 7{,}165$; $t_{\max}^{\mathrm{obs}} = 74.7$ months; 58.8\% events) predicting 120-month survival, representing 60\% extrapolation beyond observed data. SPARC achieves C-index of 0.760 at $\tau = 120$ months and 0.900 at $\tau = 60$ months, substantially outperforming Cox proportional hazards (0.554), Random Survival Forests (0.563), and DeepSurv (0.497 to 0.526). Ablation experiments demonstrate that isotonic calibration contributes the largest improvement (+0.108 C-index at $\tau = 120$m). Validation on METABRIC ($n = 2{,}509$) and melanoma ($n = 205$) datasets confirms generalizability with calibration error $\leq 0.30\%$. Moreover, we are going to publicly publish Our data set at \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17163267} for the research community.
