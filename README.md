SPARC: SURVIVAL PSEUDO-LABEL ADAPTIVE REFINEMENT AND CALIBRATION
# Abstract
Predicting survival beyond the maximum observed follow-up time poses a core methodological difficulty: when the prediction horizon $\tau$ exceeds $t\_{\text{obs\_max}}$, standard methods either fail outright or require parametric assumptions that cannot be empirically validated. We introduce SPARC (Survival Prediction via Adaptive Refinement and Calibration), which addresses this by iteratively refining pseudo-labels guided by survival-theoretic constraints. Unlike conventional pseudo-observation approaches that treat these estimates as fixed preprocessing outputs, SPARC refines them across iterations while enforcing hard constraints, deceased patients must have near-zero survival probability ($\leq 0.001$), and censored patients must retain a minimum probability ($\geq 0.20$) reflecting their continued at-risk status. We evaluated SPARC on a clinical cohort ($n = 7{,}165$; $t_{\text{obs\_max}} = 74.7$ months; $58.8\%$ events), predicting 120-month survival---a $60.6\%$ extrapolation beyond observed data. Under 5-fold cross-validation, SPARC achieved a C-index of $0.850$ at $\tau = 120$ months (95\% CI: $0.779$--$0.922$) and $0.853$ at $\tau = 60$ months (95\% CI: $0.777$--$0.929$). These results represent statistically significant improvements over Cox proportional hazards ($0.559$), Random Survival Forests ($0.559$), and DeepSurv ($0.497$) (paired $t$-test $p < 0.002$; DeLong test $p < 0.0001$). Ablation studies identified time-aware calibration as the largest contributor to performance gains ($+0.082$ C-index at $\tau = 120$m). External validation on METABRIC ($n = 2{,}509$) and melanoma ($n = 205$) datasets confirmed generalizability with calibration error $\leq 0.30\%$. SPARC enables long-term, clinically actionable prognosis where conventional methods cannot.
